Introduction
##################################

This is the fermiPy documentation page.  fermiPy is a set of python
modules and scripts that automate analysis with the Fermi Science
Tools.  fermipy provides a configuration-file driven workflow in which
the analysis parameters (data selection, IRFs, and ROI model) are
defined in a user-specified YAML file.  The analysis is controlled
with a set of python classes that provide methods to execute various
analysis tasks.  For a short introduction to using fermiPy see the
:ref:`quickstart` page.
