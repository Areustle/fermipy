``bin_index``	2.0	Spectral index that will be use when fitting the energy distribution within an energy bin.
``cov_scale``	3.0	Scale factor that sets the strength of the prior on nuisance parameters that are free.  Setting this to None disables the prior.
``fix_background``	True	Fix all background parameters before starting the fit. If False then any parameters that are currently free in the model will be fit simultaneously with the source of interest.
``free_radius``	None	Free normalizations of background sources within this angular distance in degrees from the source of interest.  If None then no sources will be freed.  Note that this parameter supersedes `fix_background`.
``ul_confidence``	0.95	Confidence level for upper limit calculation.
``use_local_index``	False	Use a power-law approximation to the shape of the global spectrum in each bin.  If this is false then a constant index set to `bin_index` will be used.
